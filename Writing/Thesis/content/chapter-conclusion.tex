\section{Future Work}
\label{sec:conclusion:future}

- deeper analysis of meta features, e.g. add some, remove some, consider trade-off time accuracy
- better fitting of learning algorithms to meta data (more manual work, but of course consider danger of overfitting!
- compare against other tools that rank r.g. the Jan van Rijn one
- more careful training by hand-selecting datasets for training (but then aains is this really the real world anymore? But then again duplicates may be contained)
- hyperparameters neglected here, may include standard combinations in future work (or random ones)-> possible only if id by string
- use this for regression
- use this to try to predict other measures (e.g. time needed)
