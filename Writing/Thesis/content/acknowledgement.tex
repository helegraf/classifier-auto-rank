I would like to thank Prof. Dr. HÃ¼llermeier for trusting me with this topic, and for his useful feedback on the matter. A very special gratitude goes out to Marcel Wever and Felix Mohr, without whose helpful insights and encouragement this thesis could not have been completed. Thank you for your explanations when I was struggling, and for pointing me in the right direction when I ran the risk of losing focus. My sincere thanks also goes to the proofreaders, who meticulously corrected my spelling and pointed out weak explanations. Last but not least, I am grateful for my family and friends for always supporting me and believing in me, and reminding me that I, too, need some sleep once in a while.
